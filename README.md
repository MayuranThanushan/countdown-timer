# Countdown Timer

This project is a simple countdown timer built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that displays the countdown timer.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file used to style the countdown timer and the layout.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the countdown logic.

## Features

- Countdown starts from xx:xx and counts down to zero.
- Clean and simple UI with the timer centered on the page.
- Easy to customize the initial countdown time by changing the `totalSeconds` variable in the `script.js` file.

## Customization

- **Change Countdown Time:** 
  - Open `script.js` and modify the `totalSeconds` variable to set a different starting time.
  
    ```javascript
    let totalSeconds = 300; // Modify this to set a different time
    ```

- **Change Design:**
  - Modify the styles in `styles.css` to adjust the look and feel of the timer.
